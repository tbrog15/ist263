        <p>
            My name is Tyler Rogers, and I am an economics major with interests in working in marketing, specifically in the field of technology. I am experienced in Python coding language and am an excellent problem solver. My hobbies include woodworking, painting, music, and ice hockey. I am the oldest of 3 children and have a 2-year-old golden retriever named Shea. I am a fan of film and cinema, especially Christopher Nolan, Quentin Tarantino, and the Jon Favreau.

        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
            In my sophomore year of high school, I transferred to a <strong>boarding school</strong> and reclassed while doing so, which resulted in me living in dorms for 5 years, including my first 2 years at Syracuse. My great-uncle, James Bennett, is an alumnus of Syracuse University and was a member of the 1959 football team that won the National Championship. I am from a small town in Massachusetts 20 minutes outside of Boston and a passionate Boston sports fan.
